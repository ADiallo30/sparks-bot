Once you have your sd card with raspbian, open the sd card in the file explorer and add a file called 'wpa_supplicant.conf'. Copy and paste the following into it.
```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
	ssid="MyWiFiNetwork"
	psk="aVeryStrongPassword"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Additionally, create a blank file called 'ssh' (with no file extension) so that you can access the device remotely and without a keyboard and monitor.


Then, if you are on Windows install PuTTY. It allows you to talk to Unix/Linux computers. Once that is installed, you should be able to ssh into the hostname 'raspberry pi' using port '22' and the ssh protocol. The command is:

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```
